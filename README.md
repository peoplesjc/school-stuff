# school-stuff
a place where to put code from Merrimack MS CS program


This repo also contains projects 4 and 5 from this semester.

Project 4 is a simple program that takes a list of integers and sorts them from smallest to largest and saves them into a linked list using the collections framework. 

Project 5 was to perform a maintenance task and to switch the program from project 4 to also takes a list of integers and sorts them from smallest to largest using the collection frameworks but this time it used  a stack.
